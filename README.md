AI-Powered Resume Builder Using OpenAI + Flask! 💻📄

✨ What It Does:
✔️ Takes basic details like name, education, skills, and experience
✔️ Uses the OpenAI GPT model to generate a professional summary
✔️ Built using Flask (Python) with a simple and clean frontend

🛠️ Tech Stack:
Python · Flask · HTML/CSS · OpenAI API · JavaScript

💡 What I Learned:

Integrating external AI APIs

Prompt engineering with user context

Building and testing full-stack apps

Handling API rate limits & deployment constraints

📌 Note:
Due to limited API quota (I’m currently on a free OpenAI plan), the app is running locally only, but it’s fully built and functional. I plan to deploy it once I upgrade to a paid tier.
